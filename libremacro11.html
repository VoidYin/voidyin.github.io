    11. The Dispatcher
</p>
<p>
    This chapter builds on previous coverage of the OpenOffice.org paradigm and then introduces the dispatcher. The
    dispatcher provides a simple mechanism for invoking internal functionality with limited
</p>
<p>
    knowledge of how the internals work, but it is considered the least-favored way of controlling OpenOffice.org.
</p>
<h1 id="the-environment">
    11.1. The environment
</h1>
<p>
    OpenOffice.org separates a component’s (document's) functionality into the model, the controller, and the frame.
</p>
<h1 id="frame">
    FRAME
</h1>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Combines the pieces; it contains a model’s controller and knows all about the display window. The frame does
        not, however, have any display window functionality; the frame just knows that display windows exist.
    </p>
    <p>
        Send a dispatch to the frame, because it controls things and knows how to route a dispatch.

    11.1.1. Two different methods to control OOo
</h2>
<p>
    The most versatile method to manipulate an OOo document is to get the internal UNO objects and manipulate them.
    Using the model provides significant control, but you must understand much about the different services and
    interfaces.
</p>
<p>
    Another method, which requires very little understanding of the OOo internals, is to use a UNO dispatcher. The
    dispatcher accepts a command such as “.uno:Undo” and takes care of the rest of the details. The frame provides the
    required dispatchers to perform the work. For simplicity, think of issuing a dispatch as very similar to selecting
    an action from the menu.
</p>
<p>
    Although direct control using UNO services provides the most control and versatility, some operations are much
    easier to perform using the dispatcher; sometimes a dispatcher is the only way to accomplish a task. For example,
    the dispatcher is the best solution for handling the clipboard. Even the macro recorder performs almost all tasks
    using a dispatcher.
</p>
<p>
    Three things are required to accomplish tasks using a dispatcher: (1) the command to dispatch, (2) arguments that
    control the dispatch, and (3) an object capable of performing the dispatch (a dispatch provider, which is usually a
    frame). Each document has a controller that, loosely speaking, acts as the interface between the outside world and
    the document. For example, use the current controller to select text, find the current cursor location, or determine
    which sheet is active in a spreadsheet. The current controller can also return the frame of the document, which
    supports the dispatch command. Listing 241. The DispatchHelper service greatly simplifies executing dispatches.
    oDispHelper = createUnoService("com.sun.star.frame.DispatchHelper")
</p>
<p>
    The dispatch helper implements the function executeDispatch, which implements most of the functionality required to
    perform a dispatch. Table 94 contains a list of the arguments supported by the executeDispatch method.
</p>
<p>
    While executing a dispatch, as discussed here, you cannot dispatch a command to a frame based on its name — either
    leave the target frame empty or enter “_self”. It is also, therefore, not important to use anything other than zero,
    or omit the argument completely, for the search flag. Attempting to specify another frame results in a run-time
    error (it seems silly to me that the arguments exist if they are not usable<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>).

<p>
    The dispatch commands have both a name and a number, called a “slot.” Although a dispatch can be made based on
    either, the developers told me that the slot number may change in the future so it is safer to use the name. If you
    must use a slot, the Tools library contains a subroutine called DispatchSlot, which performs a dispatch based on a
    slot number alone. Listing 243. Dispatch to a numeric slot.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        'Include this library to use the DispatchSlot command.
    </p>
    <p>
        GlobalScope.BasicLibraries.LoadLibrary("Tools")
    </p>
    <p>
        DispatchSlot(5301) 'Load the About dialog, same as ".uno:About"
    </p>
    <p>
        TIP You cannot call a routine in a library unless the library is loaded. You can load a library manually from
        the Macro dialog and you can load it using the LoadLibrary command as shown in Listing 243. The Tools library
        included with OOo contains the DispatchSlot subroutine.
    </p>

<p>
    Some dispatch commands require arguments. The example in Listing 244 perform a dispatch with arguments. The GoToCell
    command needs to know which cell to go to. This macro moves the current cursor to the cell B3 in a spreadsheet
    document. Listing 244. Dispatch commands can use arguments.

    <p>
        Dim args2(0) as new com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue args2(0).Name = "ToPoint"

    11.1.2. Finding dispatch commands

<p>
    A complete list of dispatch commands is tricky to find. Previously, I assembled a complete list of all supported
    dispatch commands, but, the list changes and it is not clear to me that it is of much user. As such, I decided to
    tell you how to find the list on your own. If there is a demand for it, I may be convinced to compile a new list.

    Read source code
</p>
<p>
    SFX2 based components share a common base class for their Controller object implementation, SfxBaseController. For
    modules based on SFX2, it is possible to obtain the dispatches as well as the arguments by parsing the SDI files
    inside every sfx2 based module (look at the folder &lt;module&gt;/sdi/); or even parse the header files generated in
    the build environment. Consider files with names such as sfxslots.hxx, svxslots.hxx, scslots.hxx, sdslots.hxx,
    swslots.hxx, basslots.hxx, and smslots.hxx.
</p>
<p>
    For new modules it may be easier to just browse the source code; for example, in chart2:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            chart2/source/controller/main/ChartController.cxx

    11.2. Writing a macro using the dispatcher

<p>
    When you can’t find a method to accomplish a task using the UNO API, the next choice is usually to use the
    dispatcher. Macros created by the macro recorder using dispatches; use Tools | Macros | Record Macro to start the
    macro recorder.

    The macro recorder has many limitations; for example, the macro recorder usually does not track what happens when a
    dialog is opened. I discovered this limitation when I used the macro recorder to create a macro to import text
    files. The “Text (encoded)” import filter opens a dialog and asks questions about the imported file. The values
    entered in the dialog are not captured by the macro recorder.

    If you desire to write a macro using the API, start by reading through the supported commands as generated by one of
    the macros shown above.

<p>
    The “SendOutLineToStarImpress” command creates an Impress presentation with an outline created from the headings in
    the current document. No arguments are required. Listing 247. Create an Impress document with an outline from this
    document.

<blockquote>
    <p>
        Sub CreateOutlineInImpress
    </p>
    <p>
        Dim oDispHelper as object
    </p>
    <p>
        Dim oProvider As Object
    </p>
    <p>
        oProvider = ThisComponent.CurrentController.Frame
    </p>
    <p>
        oDispHelper = createUnoService("com.sun.star.frame.DispatchHelper")
        oDispHelper.executeDispatch(oProvider,".uno:SendOutlineToStarImpress",_
    </p>

        "", , Array())

    11.3. Dispatch failure – an advanced clipboard example
</h2>
<p>
    The request was easy, copy an entire Writer document to the clipboard. The macro recorder very quickly provided a
    solution. Unfortunately, the macro fails in LO when called from a button added to the document; but it works from
    the IDE and from AOO when called from a button. The solution is to set the focus on the document, before executing
    the dispatches.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Listing 248. Select all and copy using dispatches.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sub CopyToClipboard_Dispatch dim document as object dim dispatcher as object
    </p>
    <p>
        document = ThisComponent.CurrentController.Frame
    </p>
    <p>
        ' This next line was NOT added by the macro recorder.
    </p>
    <p>
        ' Without the next line, this fails in LO when called from a button. document.ContainerWindow.setFocus
    </p>
    <p>
        dispatcher = createUnoService("com.sun.star.frame.DispatchHelper") dispatcher.executeDispatch(document,
        ".uno:SelectAll", "", 0, Array()) dispatcher.executeDispatch(document, ".uno:Copy", "", 0, Array()) End Sub
    </p>

<p>
    The API is more stable than the dispatches and works where a dispatch may fail. Another example where the API may be
    required is when the macro is invoked from OpenOffice started in headless mode; a topic not otherwise discussed in
    this document. Listing 249. Select all and copy using the API.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Sub CopyToClipboard_API() Dim o ' Transferable content.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dim oClip ' Clipboard service.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dim oContents
    </p>
    <p>
        Dim sClipName As String
    </p>
    <p>
        ThisComponent.CurrentController.Select(ThisComponent.Text) o = ThisComponent.CurrentController.getTransferable()
    </p>
    <p>
        sClipName = "com.sun.star.datatransfer.clipboard.SystemClipboard" oClip = createUnoService(sClipName) oContents
        = oClip.setContents(o, null) End Sub

    11.4. Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
    The dispatch commands are powerful and require little knowledge of the internal workings of OOo. Although some
    functionality, such as the Undo command, can only be used in the dispatcher, macros that will be used for a long
    time are better off using the internal objects directly.
